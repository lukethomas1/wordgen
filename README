This program generate all strings of the lengths specified. Therefore it generates the amount of strings equivalent to 26^x where x is
the length of the strings specified. Can generate strings of more than one length at a single time.

WARNING: Entering a large length (>10) will generate a file of enormous size.

The reason I made this is to facilitate other projects in the future. Pretty simple, but it gets the job done.
